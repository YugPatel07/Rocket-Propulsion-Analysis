DATA SOURCES & METHODOLOGY:
===========================

Primary Sources:
- NASA CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications)
- RocketCEA computational thermodynamics
- JANNAF propellant databases
- NIST Chemistry WebBook
- Astronautix.com propellant encyclopedia
- Published space agency technical reports (NASA, ESA, ISRO, JAXA, CNSA)
- Peer-reviewed aerospace engineering literature

Computational Assumptions:
- Isp values: Chamber pressure 1000-6895 kPa (1000-6000 psi typical)
- Nozzle expansion ratios: 60:1 for vacuum, appropriate for sea level
- Shifting equilibrium in exhaust
- Ideal nozzle expansion

Scoring Methodology:
- Cost scores: Relative assessment based on material availability, 
               production complexity, and purity requirements
- Safety scores: Based on MSDS hazard classifications, operational history,
                 and regulatory requirements
- Complexity scores: Industry expert consensus from published literature

Data Limitations:
- Some experimental propellants have estimated rather than measured values
- Cost data is relative and time-dependent
- Exact Isp varies with engine design details
- Flight heritage counts are approximate
- Some classified military data unavailable

=====================================================
RECOMMENDED ANALYSIS APPROACHES:
================================

For PCA (Principal Component Analysis):
- Standardize all continuous variables (z-scores)
- Consider log transformation for: Flight_Heritage_Count, Storability_Days
- Categorical variables: Create dummy variables or use correspondence analysis
- Expected primary loadings: PC1 likely performance-related, PC2 density/volume

For PLS (Partial Least Squares):
- Response variable options: Vacuum_Isp_sec, Density_Impulse, Cost_Score
- Predictor sets: Physical properties, Safety metrics, Operational factors
- Cross-validation essential for small sample size
- VIP (Variable Importance in Projection) scores identify key predictors

Clustering Analysis:
- K-means or hierarchical clustering on PC scores
- Expected clusters: Cryogenics, Hypergolics, Solids, Exotics
- Validate against Chemical_Family variable

Missing Data:
- NA values are intentional (e.g., no fuel/oxidizer for monopropellants)
- For statistical analysis, consider:
  - Separate analysis by Propellant_Type
  - Imputation where scientifically justified
  - Complete case analysis

Multicollinearity:
- Expected high correlations:
  - Vacuum_Isp_sec ↔ Characteristic_Velocity_m_s
  - Toxicity_Score ↔ Environmental_Impact_Score
  - Handling_Complexity ↔ Infrastructure_Score
- Check VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) before regression
